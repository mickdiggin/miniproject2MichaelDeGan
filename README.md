# Mini Project 2
## Description

This project will utilize pandas DataFrames and MatPlotLib to answer the following research question: how does a sample
of three household chores compare to a sample of three high-intensity competitive sports, in terms of calories burned?
The data will be retrieved via an API call to the api-ninjas "Calories Burned" API.

## Getting Started

### Install requirements with PIP

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Setup your local environment

Obtain an API key from api-ninjas (https://api-ninjas.com/) and store it in a separate .py file "login.py" in the same
directory as the main.py file. Assign it as a string to variable "theKey."

### Executing program

```
python main.py
```
